This simple pong game was a preparation for the final game used in my ft_transcendence project.

The aim of this exercise was to practice javascript as well as HTML and CSS after a long break.

Please note that at this stage the game is very simple and ball speed and bounce angle had not been developed yet.

You can launch the game by typing google-chrome index.html in your terminal inside the directory once you git clone this repository.
